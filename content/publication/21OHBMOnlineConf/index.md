summary: 
abstract: "The move from in-person to online scientific conferences due to the global health crisis has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical and legal barriers. Yet pre-existing and new challenges to truly inclusive conference experiences remain unaddressed. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, fostering social justice requires active care to be taken to center inclusivity in every aspect of online conference design. In this work, we draw from literature on recent online events and from our own experiences as researchers during the past year to identify practices that purposefully encourage diverse community attend, participate in,and lead online conferences"
