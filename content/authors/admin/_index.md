I am s a researcher in Department of Psychology at the University of Wurzburg, Germany. Her research interests include social behavior, the face perception, facial expressions, eye movement, and EEG.

I currently lead a project investigating the role of the diagnostic facial features (e.g., eyes and mouth) in the process of facial expression, which is supported by research grant from the [German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)](https://www.daad.de/en/).
